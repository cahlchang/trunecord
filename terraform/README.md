# Terraform Configuration for Music to Discord Auth Server

This directory contains Terraform configuration files to deploy the authentication server to AWS Lambda with API Gateway.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
2. Terraform installed (version >= 1.0)
3. Discord application credentials
4. Node.js and npm installed

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Lambda deployment package

First, install the dependencies for the auth server:

```bash
cd ../auth-server
npm install --production
cd ../terraform
```

### 2. Configure Terraform variables

Copy the example variables file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

Edit `terraform.tfvars` with your actual values:
- `discord_client_id`: Your Discord application's client ID
- `discord_client_secret`: Your Discord application's client secret
- `discord_bot_token`: Your Discord bot token
- `jwt_secret`: A secure random string for JWT signing
- `frontend_url`: The URL where your Electron app will run (for OAuth redirects)
- `enable_bot_token_endpoint` (optional): Leave at `"true"` for the default client flow; set to `"false"` only if the bot token is delivered through another secure channel

### 3. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 4. Plan the deployment

Review what resources will be created:

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 5. Deploy to AWS

```bash
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the deployment.

### 6. Update your Discord application

After deployment, Terraform will output the API Gateway URL. Update your Discord application's OAuth2 redirect URI to:

```
<api_gateway_url>/api/callback
```

### 7. Update your local client configuration

Update the local client to use the new API endpoint URL shown in the Terraform outputs.

## Resource Costs

The following AWS resources will be created:
- Lambda function (pay per request)
- API Gateway (pay per request)
- CloudWatch Logs (minimal storage costs)

For typical usage, costs should be minimal (< $1/month).

## Destroying Resources

To remove all created resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## State Management

By default, Terraform state is stored locally. For production use, uncomment and configure the S3 backend in `main.tf` to store state remotely.

## Environment Variables

The Lambda function uses the following environment variables:
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
- `REDIRECT_URI` (automatically configured)
- `FRONTEND_URL`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `ENABLE_BOT_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`
